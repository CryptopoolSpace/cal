# Harvest Lockup

Harvest lockup is a unique and creative farming rewards lockup mechanism created by the BecoSwap dev team. This mechanism can help us limit the frequency of harvest to prevent farming arbitrage bots from constantly harvesting and dump.

For example, the harvest lockup of the BECO-USDT farm is 2 hours. It means that farmers who stake in the BECO-BUSD farm can only harvest \(claim their rewards from farming\) every 2 hours.



You can check the harvest lockup on each farm card.

To clarify, the harvest lockup only locks users' farming rewards. The tokens and LP tokens staked in farms can be withdrawn anytime.
