# Voting

Check out TrustSwap native voting portal here: [https://snapshot.org/\#/Trustswap.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/Trustswap.eth)

**Core** - proposals posted by the TrustSwap team. The results will be actioned.

**Community** - proposals posted by the TrustSwap community. These are used to propose ideas and show the communities point of view. The TrustSwap team reviews every community vote and will often move any with strong community support up to the CORE proposal level.
