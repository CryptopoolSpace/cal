# NFT Supply Chain

Blockchains are built as distributed systems that maintain a unique and transparent data repository. Each node of the network \(each party\) contributes to adding new data and verifying their integrity. This means that all information stored on a blockchain is accessible to all parties involved, so one company can easily verify what information is being broadcasted by the other.
